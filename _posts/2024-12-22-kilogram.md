The new kilogram is defined based on Planck's constan.  It can be understood as the mass difference of the number of cesium-133  atoms in the ground state versus the same number in the excited hyperfine state.
Or,  or as the mass of the number of photons at the Cesium-133 hyperfine frequency trapped in a microwave cavity. 

What is this number?

This number can be calculated from Plancks' constant (h), the definition of a second in terms of ∆νCs: the hyperfine transition frequency of cesium-133 and the speed of light in a vacuum, and the speed of light in a vacuum (c):

count/kg = c^2 / (h * ∆νCs)

The Java calculation for 1.475521E40/kg is: 
```java
MeasurementSystem sys = MeasurementSystem.getSystem();

// Planck's constant
Quantity planck = sys.getQuantity(Constant.PLANCK_CONSTANT);
System.out.println(planck);

// cesium-133 hyperfine transition frequency
Quantity vCs = new Quantity(9.192631770E+09, Unit.HERTZ);
System.out.println(vCs);

// speed of light
Quantity c = sys.getQuantity(Constant.LIGHT_VELOCITY);
System.out.println(c);

// number of cesium 133 atoms in a kilogram
Quantity kgCount = c.power(2).divide(planck.multiply(vCs));
System.out.println(kgCount);
```

with output:
```java
